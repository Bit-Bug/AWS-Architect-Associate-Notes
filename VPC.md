# what is a VPC?
And basically, just think of a VPC as a virtual data center in the cloud.
Amazon's Virtual Private Cloud, Amazon VPC,lets you provision a logically isolated section
of the Amazon Web Services Cloud where you can launch AWS resources in a virtual network that you define.
And you have complete control
over your virtual networking environment,
including selecting your own IP address ranges,
creation of subnets and configuration of route tables
as well as network gateways.
